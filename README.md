# Configuration files for use with local/wide area network services

Greetings for all you coders, gadget builders, students, professionals and curious minded  fellows!

It has been some time now since I've created this account, but never did something significant with it. So, I'm feeling that the time is nigh, ripe for changes. The first one is to make a permanent backup of my configuration files (services, editors, pieces of code, network configurations, college works, and so on), sharing them (and maybe exchanging some knowledge along the way).

## Hardware

So far, I've done most things in legacy hardware. Keep in mind that I'm talking about "middle ages" computers, like 10-15 y.o. And, for the curious, students or learners, that'll suffice, since nowadays we have plenty of top-notch Intel's Core 2 Duo/Quad, and AMD's equivalents lying around without propper use.

Time to scavenge some old machines, to act as servers (they can share a single screen, since mostly of time I'll (prefer to) deal with Linux and BSDs running SSH without any graphical user interfaces) and hands on.

## Operational systems, basic and services-specific softwares

There are lots of tutorials out there teaching how to use most Unix-based and variants, so we shall not get too deep in details about it. But one fundamental rule is: use some flavors of them, get used to SSH routines, experiment with the various kind of thext editors (nano and pico for the newbies, vi/vim for the old school and experienced users), before trying to deeply modify your system and configuring services. It's a must!

### Slow and steady!

When you get confident enough, it's time to check if there are source codes or binaries of the services you want to implement in your lan (don't overdo yourself, don't overstep), configuring, fine tuning, making some penetration tests, before trying to go into the open (surface internet is badlands, I'm pretty sure you'll learn soon)

### Prerequisites before going to the outer seas!

- Learn every possible bit about your own network: should something nasty happen, you can figure things out quickly enough to patch up some holes or securing important data;
- Careful in what you get yourself in: same old same old. Since you guys are here, you (probably ?) know what you're doing in the web, and I'll just let things be;
- If you can afford it, go for some Raspberry hardware, since it has a much smaller power consumption than legacy hardware, and take far less space (Atom-bundled boards are a good option, if you don't care about performance issues);
- Get some networking hardware also, like 8-port switches and 4-lan-1-wan routers, and PCI NICs. Learn about network cabling, protocols, your router's configurations and your overall hardware working temperature limits.
- Reserve at least one of the good machine to act as a firewall, and make sure that it has 2 or more PCI adapters (to have an inbound connection, an outbound connection and a maintenance/management interface);
- And last, but not least: BE PATIENT! Everything has it's own caveats and workarounds, so you'll are prone to spend some time learning them.

## So what we've learnt up 'till now?

Uh... nothing new (I guess)... But then again, I think we are on the same page about the stuff that we'll share and discuss, right? So that's an excellent starting point. I'll try to keep it simple and tidy. And hope you will try your best to express your thoughts, beliefs and tips'n'tricks without too much commotion.
Guess it'sit for now. Until next time!
